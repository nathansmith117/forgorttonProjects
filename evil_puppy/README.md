# evil_puppy
Out of all of forgortton projects this one is by far the coolest.

It runs as a background app and every so often it has a full screen unquitable puppy you must pet for a while before it closes.

It has a fake anti-virus background service called "virus be gone" that will recover any deleted program files from hidden files in a jpg of the milky way.
